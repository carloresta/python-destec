# Python (and more generally programming basics) for everyone
This repository contains all the files we used during the 2024 [PhD course *Python (and more generally programming basics) for everyone*](https://destec.unipi.it/corsi/python-and-more-generally-programming-basics-everyone) at the University of Pisa, Italy (DESTEC Department).

Everything is licensed under [CC-BY-SA-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), unless taken from somewhere else, in which case their original license may supersede this.

## What are these files
The lessons were all in person, since they involved group work and live exercises. After each lesson everybody got an email with a recap of the work we did in class, some things in preparation of the following meeting and a bunch of (hopefully) useful links. You can find everything in the [`readings`](https://github.com/carloresta/python-destec/tree/main/readings) folder, together with the Jupyter notebooks we used in class. The [`exercises`](https://github.com/carloresta/python-destec/tree/main/exercises) folder instead contains some things for everybody to try at home, and the necessary data. Finally [`certificates`](https://github.com/carloresta/python-destec/tree/main/certificates) has the files I used to produce the certificates you got at the end of the course (without your actual names!). 

## Acknowledgements
Thank you to everyone who is taking the course (or who took the course, if you're reading this after Nov 2024). Thank you also to the DESTEC department of the University of Pisa for including this course in its calendar.

## Feedback
Comments are much appreciated (insults as well)! For the course of 2024, we used an anonymous feedback pad which is now offline. But please don't hesitate to write me an email or a message here on GitHub if you have any suggestions!
