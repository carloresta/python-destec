Hi!

Lesson 5 is done. Thank you to everybody who was able and willing to get this far. I had trouble sending you the files directly, so please download them from here.

We are officially done with theory, so we'll spend lessons 6, 7 and 8 doing exercises. You will also be able to work on your projects during that time. I'll be there (I don't have a choice) to help you in any way I can.

Lesson 9, as we said countless times already (sorry!) will be dedicated to your (short) project presentations. Those of you who won't be able to present on November 21st can also do it during the previous lesson.

So see you all next Thursday! In the meantime, I hope you have a nice week.


Bests,

Carlo
