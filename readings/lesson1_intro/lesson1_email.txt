Hi everyone!

First of all, thank you very much for coming to the first lesson yesterday.

Here are the readings for next time, together with a short summary of what we did and the very few slides we used. I had to compress some of the stuff since email providers may have issues with Python notebooks as attachments.

If you need any help, or if you want to start working on your personal project, don't hesitate to write.


See you on the 3rd!


Bests,
Carlo
